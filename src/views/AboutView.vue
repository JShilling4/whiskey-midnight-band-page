        Welcome to Whiskey Midnightâ€™s page. Thank you for taking the time to
        learn about who we are and what we do. Wes Creekmore and Justin Shilling
        began playing music together 10+ years ago and have been friends ever
        since. Justin is a native of Syracuse, Indiana and has extensive studio
        experience and began playing guitar at a young age. Wes was born and
        raised in Pierceton, Indiana and was inspired to pick up the guitar from
        his late father Charlie Creekmore. Wes has been influenced by many
        styles but has a love for outlaw and retro country whereas Justin got
        his start playing in bands primarily focused in the rock genre. This
        makes for a great combination with the ability to cover many styles and
        sounds. We hope you will join us at a show and become part of the
        Whiskey Midnight fan base.

          <p class="question">
            How do two guys perform with the sound & energy of a full band?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Wes & Justin add live electric & acoustic guitar with vocals to
            tracks that they pre-record - arranged with bass guitar and drums.
            Using pro-quality gear & state of the art technology, Whiskey
            Midnight is able to bring a unique sound that is a cross between
            listening in on a live studio session and attending an all-out rock
            show.

          <p class="question">
            What kind of music can I expect to hear if I come to your show?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Your going to get down to some outlaw country from the likes of
            Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash & more. You'll be singing & dancing to
            classic rock from The Allman Brothers, Tom Petty, CCR, Skynyrd & The
            Doobie Brothers. You'll get some alternative & grunge from the 90's
            from Stone Temple Pilots, Sublime, Red Hot Chili Peppers & Bush.
            They'll bring up the energy level with some hard rock from artists
            like Staind & Metallica. When it's time to relax with a drink you'll
            get some blues from Hendrix, John Mayer & SRV. They have also been
            known to bust out acoustic guitars and jam on some Jim Croce, Billy
            Joel & Eric Church. To sum up, you're going to get some variety!
